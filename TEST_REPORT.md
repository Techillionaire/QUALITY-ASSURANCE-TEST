## üìù Additional Observations  

- **No visual confirmation or toast messages for some actions (like post filtering or onboarding success).**  
- **Button hover and active states are not consistent across UI elements.**  
- **Page transitions feel a bit abrupt ‚Äî no loading indicators when switching routes.**  
- **Dark mode toggle or theme control not available (if in scope).**

## üì¶ Deliverables  

- ‚úÖ Test Plan  
- ‚úÖ Frontend Test Execution Report  
- ‚¨ú Backend API Test Report (Pending)  
- ‚¨ú WebSocket Test Report (Pending)  
- ‚úÖ Screen recordings  
- ‚úÖ Screenshots of UI issues  
- ‚¨ú Final QA Summary Report

## üìå Conclusion (Frontend Phase)

The frontend test execution exposed several functional and UX issues, particularly in responsiveness, incomplete features, and missing user experience elements (like search, password visibility, and proper logout access). The WebSocket stream works but exhibits an initial connection delay that requires optimization. Backend and WebSocket reconnection tests remain pending for subsequent QA cycles.

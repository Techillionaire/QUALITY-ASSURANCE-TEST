## üìå Conclusion (Breach)

The frontend test execution exposed several functional and UX issues, particularly in responsiveness, incomplete features, and missing user experience elements (like search, password visibility, and proper logout access). The WebSocket stream works but exhibits an initial connection delay that requires optimization. Backend and WebSocket reconnection tests remain pending for subsequent QA cycles.

The backend test execution confirmed core functionalities like user login, post listing, category filtering, and interest management are working as expected. However, critical gaps were identified in areas such as email validation during registration, unimplemented user profile management, and password recovery flows. Token-based authentication and protected route handling performed reliably. Some error handling requires refinement for clearer feedback.
